<p>Just a quick post to say that there's more to come, but Zack Rearick's <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PoemsInWhichIAmChoppedUpSteppedOnAndSleepDeprived"><em>Poems in Which I Am Chopped up, Stepped on, and Sleep Deprived</em></a>, the newest chapbook in the Etched Press Poetry Series, has been available in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Chopped-Stepped-Deprived-Etched-ebook/dp/B00BFSGJYW">Amazon Kindle store</a> and will soon be available in print (for realz this time). You can buy it for \$5 or borrow it for free if you're Prime member. Poet Steven Vineis says, "it's superb."</p>
<p>Previous chapbooks will hopefully become available in the Kindle Store soon. Submissions will also be re-opening this summer. Also, new video-poetry isn't too far off! It's been a long time coming.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time, but like really slow clockwork, a new chapbook in the Etched Press Poetry Series is coming soon. Zack Rearick's <em>Poems in Which I Am Chopped Up, Stepped On, and Sleep Deprived</em> should be available in print in the next few weeks. We're still working on the digital version, but I'm hoping that will be available only a few weeks after in the Kindle Store. Can't wait to share it with the world. It's some very wonderful writing.</p>
<p>Zack Rearick is a recent M.A. graduate from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington. He will be pursuing a PhD in English, focusing on 20th Century American Poetry at Georgia State University in the fall.</p>

                <p>I'm still backed up on submissions, so if you haven't gotten a response I apologize. There have been some good things that have come in and I would like to publish at least three chapbooks throughout the course of this year. The first new title could come out in June or as early as April. I'm still trying to schedule it logistically. I think submission will be closed during the summer months to properly respond to existing submissions and to prepare the first issue of the literary journal. Again, I would like to thank you all for the wonderful submissions.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Etched Press is listed in the 2010 and the upcoming 2011 <a href="http://www.poetsmarket.com/">Poet's Market</a> guidebook published by Writer's Digest Books! This is bringing in a lot more submissions and more exposure to our writers. I'd like to give a special thanks to <a href="http://blog.writersdigest.com/poeticasides/">Robert Lee Brewer</a>, the 2010 edition editor, for including Etched Press in the guidebook. I think it's essential for every poet that feels his or her work is ready for publication.</p>
