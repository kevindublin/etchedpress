                <p>I'm still backed up on submissions, so if you haven't gotten a response I apologize. There have been some good things that have come in and I would like to publish at least three chapbooks throughout the course of this year. The first new title could come out in June or as early as April. I'm still trying to schedule it logistically. I think submission will be closed during the summer months to properly respond to existing submissions and to prepare the first issue of the literary journal. Again, I would like to thank you all for the wonderful submissions.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Etched Press is listed in the 2010 and the upcoming 2011 <a href="http://www.poetsmarket.com/">Poet's Market</a> guidebook published by Writer's Digest Books! This is bringing in a lot more submissions and more exposure to our writers. I'd like to give a special thanks to <a href="http://blog.writersdigest.com/poeticasides/">Robert Lee Brewer</a>, the 2010 edition editor, for including Etched Press in the guidebook. I think it's essential for every poet that feels his or her work is ready for publication.</p>
