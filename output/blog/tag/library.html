                <p>Kirby Wright's <a href="http://etchedpress.com/product/kirby-wright-green/">The Girl with the Green Violin</a> is now included as a part of the special collection at the University of California San Diego's <a href="http://roger.ucsd.edu/record=b9068451~S9">Archive for New Poetry</a>). This is the first Etched Press title introduced to the archive.</p>
<p>The Archive for New Poetry is a comprehensive research collection of American poetry and poetics reflecting and documenting alternative approaches to writing in the English language that have emerged since 1945. Although the Archive includes mainstream and academic poets, particularly those whose works are antecedent to post-war American experimental writing, most of the collection focuses on the "New American" poets: the Black Mountain poets, the Objectivist movement, the San Francisco Renaissance, the New York School, and the language writers.</p>
<p>The Archive was established in 1968 when Roy Harvey Pearce, professor of literature at UC San Diego, donated important first editions of post-war American poets to the UC San Diego Library. The collection now numbers over 35,000 volumes, 1,800 serial titles, over 700 poetry broadsides, extensive manuscript holdings, and over 1,500 audio recordings, all of which support intense research use by students, scholars and writers internationally.</p>

<p>Etched Press is proud to be a part of such a important collection. Congratulations to Kirby Wright! Wright was born and raised in Honolulu, Hawaii. He is a graduate of Punahou School in Honolulu and the University of California at San Diego. He received his MFA in Creative Writing from San Francisco State University. Wright has been nominated for the Pushcart Prize and is a past recipient of the Ann Fields Poetry Prize, the Academy of American Poets Award, the Browning Society Award for Dramatic Monologue, and Arts Council Silicon Valley Fellowships in Poetry and The Novel. Wright is also the author of the companion novels <em>Punahou Blues</em> and <em>Moloka’i Nui Ahina</em>, both set in Hawaii. His third novel <em>The End, My Friend</em> is currently being adapted into a film. More information on the archive can be found <a href="http://libraries.ucsd.edu/collections/sca/collections/archive-for-new-poetry.html">here</a>.</p>
