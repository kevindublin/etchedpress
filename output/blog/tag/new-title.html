                <p>Etched Press would like to announce the publication of two new chapbooks: <em>The Singing is My Favorite Part </em>by Susan Elliott Brown and <em>The Girl with the Green Violin </em>by Kirby Wright. They are the fifth and sixth titles in the Etched Press Poetry Series, respectively. You can read about the two new chapbooks in the <a href="http://etchedpress.com/shop/">Etched Press Shop</a> or on Amazon if you have a Kindle (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0161CE6O6">The Singing</a> / <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Violin-Etched-Press-Poetry-ebook/dp/B0161QLBZE">The Girl</a></em>).</p>
<p>Read a poem from the first of the two new chapbooks, <em>The Singing is My Favorite Part:</em><br>
<strong>Eutrophication </strong>| Susan Elliott Brown</p>
<p>The dock rots beneath your feet,<br>
fish-stale water green<br>
around its posts. Mosquitoes<br>
land on the oily film that thickens<br>
the surface, dotting<br>
its topography with sparkling<br>
holes, like dust particles glowing<br>
in a light beam through a basement<br>
window. Toads breed near the teeming<br>
banks. The air smells metallic,<br>
the way your hands smell after<br>
you ride the carousel at the mall,<br>
gripping the brass pole<br>
that impales your horse.</p>
<p>And a poem from <em>The Girl with the Green Violin</em>:<br>
<strong>Carrots on Snow</strong> | Kirby Wright</p>
<p>A flame has been extinguished in mother, not the fire of life but that spark wanting independence. She displays a certain resignation, one that causes her face to droop as if melting. Her body sags in the chair. The dining table’s cluttered with magazines, keys, unopened credit card statements and utility bills, newspapers, and expired coupons from Whole Foods. She nods solemnly when I suggest she consider a live-in to help prepare meals and keep things tidy. “You could be like roommates,” I smile, “and, best of all, she could drive you everywhere.” “Driving Miss Lonely,” she smirks, getting up. She weaves her way through a gauntlet of boxes marked for recycling, crates of junk mail, and plastic bins filled with ornaments. She shuffles past the Christmas tree and falls into the loveseat beside the window. She studies the rabbits. They’re gnawing the carrots she stacked at dawn on the snow.</p>

                <p>I'm still backed up on submissions, so if you haven't gotten a response I apologize. There have been some good things that have come in and I would like to publish at least three chapbooks throughout the course of this year. The first new title could come out in June or as early as April. I'm still trying to schedule it logistically. I think submission will be closed during the summer months to properly respond to existing submissions and to prepare the first issue of the literary journal. Again, I would like to thank you all for the wonderful submissions.</p>
<p>In case you didn't know, Etched Press is listed in the 2010 and the upcoming 2011 <a href="http://www.poetsmarket.com/">Poet's Market</a> guidebook published by Writer's Digest Books! This is bringing in a lot more submissions and more exposure to our writers. I'd like to give a special thanks to <a href="http://blog.writersdigest.com/poeticasides/">Robert Lee Brewer</a>, the 2010 edition editor, for including Etched Press in the guidebook. I think it's essential for every poet that feels his or her work is ready for publication.</p>
