                <p>Etched Press would like to announce the publication of two new chapbooks: <em>The Singing is My Favorite Part </em>by Susan Elliott Brown and <em>The Girl with the Green Violin </em>by Kirby Wright. They are the fifth and sixth titles in the Etched Press Poetry Series, respectively. You can read about the two new chapbooks in the <a href="http://etchedpress.com/shop/">Etched Press Shop</a> or on Amazon if you have a Kindle (<em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0161CE6O6">The Singing</a> / <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Green-Violin-Etched-Press-Poetry-ebook/dp/B0161QLBZE">The Girl</a></em>).</p>
<p>Read a poem from the first of the two new chapbooks, <em>The Singing is My Favorite Part:</em><br>
<strong>Eutrophication </strong>| Susan Elliott Brown</p>
<p>The dock rots beneath your feet,<br>
fish-stale water green<br>
around its posts. Mosquitoes<br>
land on the oily film that thickens<br>
the surface, dotting<br>
its topography with sparkling<br>
holes, like dust particles glowing<br>
in a light beam through a basement<br>
window. Toads breed near the teeming<br>
banks. The air smells metallic,<br>
the way your hands smell after<br>
you ride the carousel at the mall,<br>
gripping the brass pole<br>
that impales your horse.</p>
<p>And a poem from <em>The Girl with the Green Violin</em>:<br>
<strong>Carrots on Snow</strong> | Kirby Wright</p>
<p>A flame has been extinguished in mother, not the fire of life but that spark wanting independence. She displays a certain resignation, one that causes her face to droop as if melting. Her body sags in the chair. The dining table’s cluttered with magazines, keys, unopened credit card statements and utility bills, newspapers, and expired coupons from Whole Foods. She nods solemnly when I suggest she consider a live-in to help prepare meals and keep things tidy. “You could be like roommates,” I smile, “and, best of all, she could drive you everywhere.” “Driving Miss Lonely,” she smirks, getting up. She weaves her way through a gauntlet of boxes marked for recycling, crates of junk mail, and plastic bins filled with ornaments. She shuffles past the Christmas tree and falls into the loveseat beside the window. She studies the rabbits. They’re gnawing the carrots she stacked at dawn on the snow.</p>

<p>The next chapbook from Etched Press, <em>Flotsam</em> by <a href="http://www.catherinebaileykyle.com/" title="Catherine Kyle">Catherine Kyle</a>, will soon be published as a part of the Etched Press Poetry Series. Kyle has crafted a world filled with magical realism, in a traditional and nontraditional sense. The lyrics in <em>Flotsam</em> are imbued with spells. She invokes the ocean, ships, and urban and rural villages to craft a modern fairy tale. This is a chapbook that explores unconscious and conscious desires. Kyle expertly wields vivid imagery, lovely rhythms, textured verbs and taut metaphors. This chapbook explores the idea that "the line between flotsam and jetsam is want." We learn that "humans distinguish the things waves do not." By the end, <em>Flotsam</em> takes readers through the waters, across landscapes real and imagined to transform us until "we have become / the forest itself."</p>
<p><em>Flotsam</em> will be available as a print chapbook in the <a href="http://etchedpress.com/products-page/" title="Etched Press Shop">Etched Press Shop</a> and as an ebook via <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flotsam-Etched-Press-Poetry-Book-ebook/dp/B00T1SWNMU/">Amazon Kindle</a> on Valentine's Day.</p>
