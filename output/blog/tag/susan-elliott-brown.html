<strong>Eutrophication </strong>| Susan Elliott Brown</p>
<p>The dock rots beneath your feet,<br>
fish-stale water green<br>
around its posts. Mosquitoes<br>
land on the oily film that thickens<br>
the surface, dotting<br>
its topography with sparkling<br>
holes, like dust particles glowing<br>
in a light beam through a basement<br>
window. Toads breed near the teeming<br>
banks. The air smells metallic,<br>
the way your hands smell after<br>
you ride the carousel at the mall,<br>
gripping the brass pole<br>
that impales your horse.</p>
<p>And a poem from <em>The Girl with the Green Violin</em>:<br>
<strong>Carrots on Snow</strong> | Kirby Wright</p>
<p>A flame has been extinguished in mother, not the fire of life but that spark wanting independence. She displays a certain resignation, one that causes her face to droop as if melting. Her body sags in the chair. The dining table’s cluttered with magazines, keys, unopened credit card statements and utility bills, newspapers, and expired coupons from Whole Foods. She nods solemnly when I suggest she consider a live-in to help prepare meals and keep things tidy. “You could be like roommates,” I smile, “and, best of all, she could drive you everywhere.” “Driving Miss Lonely,” she smirks, getting up. She weaves her way through a gauntlet of boxes marked for recycling, crates of junk mail, and plastic bins filled with ornaments. She shuffles past the Christmas tree and falls into the loveseat beside the window. She studies the rabbits. They’re gnawing the carrots she stacked at dawn on the snow.</p>
