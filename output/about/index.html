                <h1>About</h1>
                <p><strong>Etched Press</strong> is a micro press currently based inÂ San Francisco, California. After a brief hiatus of publishing, we're back with a new look (migrated from a slow Wordpress installation to a faster static setup). Etched Press was founded in 2008 in Wilmington, North Carolina as the Etched Press Poetry Series as a way to publish chapbooks that fit the maxim "writing that remains." We seek to publish chabooks by emerging writers that bridge gaps between schools of poetry. We want work that reads fresh and exciting because of its use of multiple forms. We're also fans of prose poetry. Our books are available on our website, on Amazon Kindle, and at author readings. Etched Press is also now interested in publishing solicited anthologies and solicited full-length manuscripts. Beginning in 2023, through a partnership with <a href="https://thelivingroomsf.com">The Living Room Reading Series &amp; Salon</a>, Etched Press will publish three to five titles annually.</p>
<p><strong>Etched Press Society</strong>, the community outreach branch of Etched Press will also partner and be absorbed by The Living Room. We send members into local schools and community spaces to promote the creation and maintenance of creative writing arts education programs, especially during National Poetry Month (April).</p>
