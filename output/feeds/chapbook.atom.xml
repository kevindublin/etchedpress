This Frayed Universe is a chapbook of poems by Sarah Brashear.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Frayed Universe&lt;/em&gt; is a chapbook of poems by Sarah Brashear. It describes our heavy and beautiful world and the crisis of the ordinary human coping with the everyday effects of life. Brashear’s rich language shows that not only is being a person a blessing, but at times, an unexpected disaster. Through her strong images, she is able to illustrate what many other authors have also shown—that within the unordinary is the ordinary, and that perhaps this insanity we diagnose in others is actually our sanity.&lt;/p&gt;
