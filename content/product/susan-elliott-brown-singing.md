“Susan Elliott Brown’s poems are so whip-smart, so elegant I need to dress up to read them. I’d like to take them to a Montmartre café so they can feel the sun of Paris as I savor each with coffee and croissant. I’d like to make them my tiny house, and open my eyes to them every day.”

–Angela Ball, author of *The Night Clerk at the Hotel of Both Worlds*
