"Every single poem in *Before OnStar* rattles around the corner like a firetruck on three wheels, siren blaring."

-Michael Dennis at [Today's Book of Poetry](http://michaeldennispoet.blogspot.ca/2015/08/before-onstar-sarah-carson-etched-press.html)

"Sarah Carson has an imaginative gift for transporting us within the nuances & netherworld of her hometown. I can’t imagine a more dead-eye illumination of the region—told with incredible wit & a rough-minded passion. Many might steer you from the town itself, but missing out on Buick City would be a decidedly wrong turn. I will gladly enjoy returning to these pages—and often."

-Ben Hamper, author of *Rivethead,* on Sarah Carson's work
