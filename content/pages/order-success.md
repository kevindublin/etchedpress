**Thank you** for supporting Etched Press and the work of poets we genuinely love! We're happy that you also connect with the work of such talented writers. Your order will be reviewed and promptly shipped, but please allow a little time as we're a small team. You’ve settled on an incredible choice, and we’re anxious for you to receive your order. Please let us know what you think about the work once you've had a chance to read it. You can also reach out if you have any questions beforehand. You can email us diretly through the [contact page](./contact/).

And if you are a poet, please consider [sending us your work as well](./submit/). And if you're in the Area or plan to visit, [you should join us in The Living Room as a guest or featured reader](https://thelivingroomsf.com/).
