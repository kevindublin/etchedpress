**Manuscript Guidelines:**

Prepare one-inch margins on all sides of your document. Include your manuscript title in the header of each page. In your cover letter, type your name, MS. title, and contact information. All individual poems must also have titles in bold and each poem must be on a separate page.

Submit 16-28 pages of poetry to our chapbook series. We read submissions year-round and will now be able to respond more quickly than ever before. Selected submissions will have their chapbook set, printed, bound, and the poet will receive 10 author copies. Further copies are sold in our online bookstore as well as other online retailers. Authors can later obtain their own copies at a discount. Additionally, authors can get thier book into local bookstores by having the bookstores order from distributors. We will work directly with the author throughout the entire process. The layout and cover of the chapbook will be a few of the things the author will help decide.

Simultaneous submissions welcome. Please withdraw via submittable if accepted elsewhere.
