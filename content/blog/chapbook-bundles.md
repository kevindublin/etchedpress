One of my favorite things to do is collect chapbooks. They're short, elegant ![chapbook-bundles](http://etchedpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/chapbook-bundle-150x150.png){.alignleft .wp-image-253 .size-thumbnail width="150" height="150"}(and occasionally inelegant) collections of poems that I can read in one sitting. I get them at festivals, directly from poets, and online from small presses. I even publish them. One of my favorite ways to acquire chapbooks is through chapbook bundles. I thought it was about time that Etched Press joined a group of small/micro presses that also offer them. Our catalog might not be as extensive, but it is ever-growing.
