The next chapbook from Etched Press, *Flotsam* by [Catherine Kyle](http://www.catherinebaileykyle.com/ "Catherine Kyle"), will soon be published as a part of the Etched Press Poetry Series. Kyle has crafted a world filled with magical realism, in a traditional and nontraditional sense. The lyrics in *Flotsam* are imbued with spells. She invokes the ocean, ships, and urban and rural villages to craft a modern fairy tale. This is a chapbook that explores unconscious and conscious desires. Kyle expertly wields vivid imagery, lovely rhythms, textured verbs and taut metaphors. This chapbook explores the idea that "the line between flotsam and jetsam is want." We learn that "humans distinguish the things waves do not." By the end, *Flotsam* takes readers through the waters, across landscapes real and imagined to transform us until "we have become / the forest itself."

*Flotsam* will be available as a print chapbook in the [Etched Press Shop](http://etchedpress.com/products-page/ "Etched Press Shop") and as an ebook via [Amazon Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Flotsam-Etched-Press-Poetry-Book-ebook/dp/B00T1SWNMU/) on Valentine's Day.
