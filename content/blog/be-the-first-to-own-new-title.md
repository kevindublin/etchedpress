Those who attend the [Annual Chapbook Festival](http://www.chapbookfestival.org "chapbookfestival") at the CUNY Graduate Center on Monday and Tuesday will be the first to be able to buy the new chapbook published by Etched Press: Before OnStar by Sarah Carson. The book won't officially be available for another two weeks, but there will be a limited number produced and available at the Chapbook Festival Book Fair. So, if you're in New York City, be sure to stop by.
