Just a quick post to say that there's more to come, but Zack Rearick's [*Poems in Which I Am Chopped up, Stepped on, and Sleep Deprived*](https://www.facebook.com/PoemsInWhichIAmChoppedUpSteppedOnAndSleepDeprived), the newest chapbook in the Etched Press Poetry Series, has been available in the [Amazon Kindle store](http://www.amazon.com/Chopped-Stepped-Deprived-Etched-ebook/dp/B00BFSGJYW) and will soon be available in print (for realz this time). You can buy it for \$5 or borrow it for free if you're Prime member. Poet Steven Vineis says, "it's superb."

Previous chapbooks will hopefully become available in the Kindle Store soon. Submissions will also be re-opening this summer. Also, new video-poetry isn't too far off! It's been a long time coming.
