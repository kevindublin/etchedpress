In his debut chapbook, Antony Fangary brings unique and examining poems about identity through the lens of family history, religion, and discrimination. At once Coptic Christian and heretic, at once American and Egyptian, Fangary captures scenes in wide-angle and a deep depth-of-field. He is able to write tender lines that lacerate in an original voice. In* Haram*, you’ll learn about the “two white boys who sold everything from coke to pitbulls / good guys to know when you’re fifteen and alone,” while being reminded to “love the fear \[God\] gives you / and be thankful for it.”
