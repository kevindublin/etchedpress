It's been a long time, but like really slow clockwork, a new chapbook in the Etched Press Poetry Series is coming soon. Zack Rearick's *Poems in Which I Am Chopped Up, Stepped On, and Sleep Deprived* should be available in print in the next few weeks. We're still working on the digital version, but I'm hoping that will be available only a few weeks after in the Kindle Store. Can't wait to share it with the world. It's some very wonderful writing.

 

Zack Rearick is a recent M.A. graduate from the University of North Carolina - Wilmington. He will be pursuing a PhD in English, focusing on 20th Century American Poetry at Georgia State University in the fall.
