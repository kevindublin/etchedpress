Read a poem from the first of the two new chapbooks, *The Singing is My Favorite Part:*  
**Eutrophication **\| Susan Elliott Brown

The dock rots beneath your feet,  
fish-stale water green  
around its posts. Mosquitoes  
land on the oily film that thickens  
the surface, dotting  
its topography with sparkling  
holes, like dust particles glowing  
in a light beam through a basement  
window. Toads breed near the teeming  
banks. The air smells metallic,  
the way your hands smell after  
you ride the carousel at the mall,  
gripping the brass pole  
that impales your horse.

 

 

And a poem from *The Girl with the Green Violin*:  
**Carrots on Snow** \| Kirby Wright

A flame has been extinguished in mother, not the fire of life but that spark wanting independence. She displays a certain resignation, one that causes her face to droop as if melting. Her body sags in the chair. The dining table’s cluttered with magazines, keys, unopened credit card statements and utility bills, newspapers, and expired coupons from Whole Foods. She nods solemnly when I suggest she consider a live-in to help prepare meals and keep things tidy. “You could be like roommates,” I smile, “and, best of all, she could drive you everywhere.” “Driving Miss Lonely,” she smirks, getting up. She weaves her way through a gauntlet of boxes marked for recycling, crates of junk mail, and plastic bins filled with ornaments. She shuffles past the Christmas tree and falls into the loveseat beside the window. She studies the rabbits. They’re gnawing the carrots she stacked at dawn on the snow.
